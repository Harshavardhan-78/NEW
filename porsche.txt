How Porsche 911â€™s Air-Cooled System is Different
High-Speed Fan: The large, engine-driven cooling fan (seen in your image) rapidly moves air across the cylinder heads and fins.
Centrifugal Cooling Design: The unique design of the fan housing and air ducts efficiently directs air over the engineâ€™s hottest areas.
Integrated Oil Cooling: Later Porsche air-cooled engines included external oil coolers to improve performance and prevent overheating.
Performance Focused: Unlike most air-cooled engines, which are built for simplicity and cost-saving, Porsche designed their system for high performance and durability.
What About Porscheâ€™s Air-Cooled Legacy?
The last air-cooled 911 was the Porsche 993 (1998 model year).
Enthusiasts still love classic air-cooled Porsches for their unique sound, simplicity, and mechanical feel.
Porsche recreated an air-cooled engine for a special project in 2018 (Project Gold 993 Turbo), but it was not for mass production.
So, while Porsche pioneered high-performance air-cooled engines, all modern 911s (starting from the 996 generation onward) use liquid cooling.
